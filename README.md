We were tasked with creating a prefix trie that allows for the insertion of words, suggests words based on an inputted string, and allows for the deletion of unwanted words. 

## Requirements
1. The trie should be able to do is take in a word. It should also keep a count of how many words have been inserted. 
2. Once the words are placed into the trie it should be able to offer some suggestions based on a word prefix.
3. The trie should contain all of the words of the alphabet.
